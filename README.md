This is the implementation of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00939">Improving Sample Quality of Diffusion Models Using Self-Attention Guidance</a> by Susung Hong, Gyuseong Lee, Wooseok Jang and Seungryong Kim. To gain insight from our careful analysis of the self-attention maps of diffusion models and detailed explanation of our method, see our [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00939).

This repository is based on [openai/improved-diffusion](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion), and we modified feature extraction code from [yandex-research/ddpm-segmentation](https://github.com/yandex-research/ddpm-segmentation) to get the self-attention maps. Pretrained weights for ImageNet and LSUN can be taken from [the repository](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion).

The code will be made available soon.
